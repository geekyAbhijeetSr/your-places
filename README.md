<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I enrolled in a project-focused course on Udemy, and this is the project we created. In "Your Places" users can create their account, share their favorite places, and update or delete their places etc. <br />
<span style="color: red">Warning:</span> It looks boring because my Instructor provided the css to speed things up, his main focus was to teach core concepts and not styling.
